# Xolo User Management Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to create and manage users in **Xolo**, including user creation, scope assignment, and license generation.

## üë§ 1. Create a User

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Role-Username Consistency Required for mictlanx-sync

For the proper functioning of mictlanx-sync, it is **mandatory** that the "role" attribute in the user creation payload must match the "username" value exactly. This means, for example, if "username" is "guest", then "role" must also be "guest".

**Endpoint:**

```
POST http://<xolo-hostname>:<xolo-port>/api/v4/users
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "username": "guest",
  "first_name": "Ignacio",
  "last_name": "Castillo",
  "email": "jcastillo@cinvestav.mx",
  "password": "guestguest",
  "profile": "",
  "role": "guest"
}
```

## Deployment
1.  Build the docker image using the following command:
	``` sh
	docker build -f ./Dockerfile -t jub-ui .
	```
2. Run the docker container using the created docker image:
	``` sh
	docker run --name <container_name> -d -p <host_port>:<docker_port> jub-ui
	```

Replace the placeholders <container_name> which represents the name of the virtual container, <host_port> represents the port of the host machine and the <docker_port> must be 80 port.

That's it, enjoy it.
